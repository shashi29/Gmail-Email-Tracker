								Hi, Greetings from SourceMantra, Please have a look at the below opportunity and reply to me if you are interested. Job: QA Automation EngineerLocation :  Jacksonville Florida (Onsite) – Need localsDuration: Long Term Contract  10+ Years and passport Number is must for Submission. Job Description:Key areas they are looking for skill wise. *C# required C# (sharp) is object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft mainly for web and desktop applications.* must know how to write custom xPaths -they are not interested in someone who only uses tools for this. *Knowledge around Constructors – what they do what are they used for, etc.. *Solid Knowledge of POM Constructors: In programming, constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an instance of the class is created. They are used to initialize the object’s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.    Thanks & RegardsSharath Reesu | Source Mantra, Inc.Senior Talent Acquisition 295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Phone : +1 908 373 8651 Ext: 243 | 732 377 8653 (Fax)Sharath@sourcemantra.com |   www.sourcemantra.com

Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.  Thanks & RegardsSrujan BurraEmail: srujan@sourcemantra.comSource Mantra Inc | www.sourcemantra.com295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)

								Greetings, We have the below requirement with our Client. Kindly go through the JD below and let me know your interest. Position: Software Automation EngineerLocation: Jacksonville Florida – 100% OnsiteDuration: 12+ Months Need USC, H1B & H4 EAD candidates only. LinkedIn & Passport Number Must for Submission. Need 10+ years’ experience  Rate: $60/hr on c2c Max. Key areas they are looking for skill wiseC# required - C# (sharp) is object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft mainly for web and desktop applications.must know how to write custom xPaths -they are not interested in someone who only uses tools for this.Knowledge around Constructors – what they do what are they used for, etc.Solid Knowledge of POM Constructors: In programming, constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an instance of the class is created. They are used to initialize the object’s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.  Thanks & RegardsSrujan BurraEmail: srujan@sourcemantra.comSource Mantra Inc | www.sourcemantra.com295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)

								Job Title: QA Automation Engineer (GC/USC) only,Location: Jacksonville FloridaDuration: 6+ months Key areas they are looking for skill wise.*C# required -C# (sharp) is object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft mainly for web and desktop applications.* must know how to write custom xPaths -they are not interested in someone who only uses tools for this.*Knowledge around Constructors – what they di what are they used for, ect.*Solid Knowledge of POM Constructors: In programming, constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an instance of the class is created. They are used to initialize the object’s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.

								Project Summary:To successfully migrate to a cloud-based phone service, the client is seeking professional services. The professional services firm will be instrumental in managing the discovery of all existing on-premises phone system configurations, identifying customer and team needs, identifying potentially costly or time-limiting risk areas, and developing detailed design documents for a cloud-based phone system that meets the client’s requirements. Additionally, the services requested herein will assist the organization with the creation of a comprehensive and extensive planning document that will provide detailed planning for porting existing user numbers between on-premises and cloud environments. Scope of Work:Task 1: Assessment: Conduct a thorough and comprehensive assessment of the client's existing phone system and infrastructure, manage the discovery and identification of all existing on-premises phone system configurations across all client sites, identify customer and team needs, and identify potentially costly or time-limiting risk areas in alignment with the organization's business requirements and best practices.Task 2: Design Documents: Develop and deliver detailed and comprehensive design documents and an implementation plan inclusive of all client sites. Minimum Qualification (MQ):Minimum 10 years of verifiable experience designing phone system solutions for multi-location organizations with at least 3,000 users. Examples of acceptable verifiable documentation include:Detailed Purchase Order/invoicesClient letter on company letterhead/emailThe documentation must confirm the following details: (a) project scope, (b) project cost, (c) project start and end dates, and (d) client name. Business Requirements:Transition 90% or more of the current phone system endpoints to a cloud-based system that meets the client’s requirements.Proposed service provider should be a Tier 1 Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) with coverage across the seven Northern California counties in which the client operates.Proposed solution must support a distributed deployment to over 60 locations and provide local, secondary, and tertiary redundancy for call routing.Proposed solution should be capable of Microsoft 365 integration to facilitate “Dial by Name” and full integration with existing Identity and Directory systems to ensure up-to-date contact information is accessible and used at all times.Solution must support Direct Routing to enable a seamless transition from the existing Avaya infrastructure.Phone number porting of existing DIDs is required. The client will not accept new phone numbers.Maintain 5-digit dialing wherever possible during migration and once the solution is fully implemented.Subject matter expert to provide technical support for legacy digital and analog devices via Direct Routing using SBC & media gateways.Control calling plans by policy, based on individual user requirements (Domestic local vs. Long-distance/International).Emergency calling and location-based routing must be identified and prioritized based on the precise physical location of the facility where the call originated. Example: a 911 call made from Moccasin, California, must route to local 911 emergency services and provide geographical location to emergency and law enforcement services to the facility in Moccasin, where the call originated.Where appropriate, media bypass should be used to optimize network traffic.Since the cultural transition to “soft phones” will vary by site and user persona group, the client should be able to increase/decrease endpoint count on demand.Provide a consistent and seamless solution across all client sites, with a single support model and centralized management and administration.Service Level Agreements (SLA) must align with the operation requirements of each client facility and will be further defined once the final phone system architecture is completed. Generally, response time during an unexpected outage should be no more than one (1) hour, with disruption to service being no more than one (1) business day. Design must consider resiliency for critical facilities and operations that will ultimately define SLAs.

								Hi,Hope you are all doing well,Please find the details of Requirement,Title: Senior Golang/ C++ DeveloperLocation: Remote- Chicago, ILvideo interviewVisa: GC/ USC/ H4/GC EadNeed LinkedInSharp, legitimate candidates only! 6 or more years of experience More information on Fortra role – there are 2 – this is a for sure placement for right candidate. We need to certify DG agent running on ARM processor based Windows Machines. Update compiler from 2019 (very outdated) to 2022 (latest).Kernel down in our code needs to be recompiled in ARM - everything above the kernel at the user level can continue to be compiled in x86_64 and run through some form of emulation.Hooking app needs to be rewritten - small bit of low level intricate assembler code that hooks into the kernel. Microsoft recommends looking at a more standard way of achieving this,Driver setup INF - config needs to be updated to add ARM support Automation needs - We need to have the Automation RF running Agents on ARM Build pipeline updates to produce ARM binaries in parallel with the existing x86/64 binaries.  Programming Languages: Proficiency in C/C++ and go.Familiarity with other languages such as Python, PowerShell, can be beneficialWindows APIs: Experience with Win32, COM, or UWP (Universal Windows Platform) APIs for interacting with the Windows OS.Windows Internals: Strong understanding of Windows architecture and Windows kernel driversProblem-Solving & Analytical Skills Ability to troubleshoot complex issues, especially those related to Windows internals like memory leaks, application crashes, and performance bottlenecks.Strong analytical mindset to diagnose issues in the operating system or application layers.Development Tools: Proficiency with Visual Studio, Git, and CI/CD tools for version control and deployment. Nice to have • Debugging: Proficiency with ARM-specific debugging tools and emulators, like WinDbg for ARM or Visual Studio’s remote debugging for ARM devices.• Cross-Compilation: Experience with cross-compiling x86 applications to ARM, which involves configuring compilers and build systems (e.g., MSBuild, CMake) to generate ARM-compatible binaries.• Windows on ARM: Familiarity with Windows 10/11 for ARM, including the Windows Subsystem for ARM and ARM64EC, which allows mixing x86 and ARM code in a single process. Libraries and Dependencies: Be aware of dependencies and external libraries that may need to be replaced or recompiled for ARM. Not all x86 libraries will work directly on ARM, so it's crucial to identify and resolve those issues.  Thanks,SunnyIT RecruiterSource InfoTech Inc.,Email: sunny@sourceinfotech.com

								  Hi This is Sneha from GAC Solution. I have an excellent job opportunity with one of our premier clients. Since it is an urgent requirement your prompt response is appreciated. The following is a brief job description for your reference. Job Title: Data Scientist.Working Location: Miami Beach, FL (Onsite)Project Duration: Contract To enhance our Contact Center analytics capibilities by delivering Intent Classification / Agent Identification (RCI/CEL)Deliver comprehensive call analytics to include (a)relevant call driver topics, (b) caller identity (such as agents), and (c) caller sentiments from recordings (using NLP technology similar to ChatGPT). This work would expand upon the initial pilot to identify VTG agents calling the Contact Center for topics that can be handled by Trade Automation. Strong synergy between this use-case and GenAI Content Summarization.Lead Prioritization (Primarily CEL): Introduce in-house lead-scoring system that would be roughly comparable to the RCI system. This would include using AI to selectively sort thousands of potential North American leads based on a lead's conversion probability and consider different lead sources, such as Web, CTI, and Booked to Cancelled. Booked to Cancel leads would would be a novel lead source for RCI Thank You, Best RegardsSneha SangnaleTechnical RecruiterE: sneha@gacsol.com  www.gacsol.com‘Experts in Digitalization and Engineering - Enterprise 4.0’

Use Python or R perform statistical and causal modeling; create visualizations; 4. Use Tableau to create interactive visualizations 5. Require excellent communication skills My goal is to add people to the team who have experience with formal data analysis, which generally entails probabilistic and statistical modeling, experimental design and analysis, causal modeling, and explanatory machine learning. I would expect anyone who can do those things is proficient with the standard tools, like Python, SQL, and Tableau. One of the main challenges I have faced is that most of the contractors I have interviewed equate building visualizations and dashboards to analysis, when that?s actually just the starting point. Data exploration is essential, but insufficient to derive robust insights.

								Job Description -Report Automation SpecialistClient:- HBI Solutions. This is a quick job - not a long term position.  I need someone to develop a method for taking the attached report and hundreds like it (same format, different data), and putting them into a template that will make it look like a polished report with graphics. There are 4 tabs of aggregate data and 3 of patient level data that will need to remain in a tabular Excel format but would be nice to add color there as well.   The image below is not what I am looking for - but it is the concept - make it not look like Excel.  Do you have someone who can do this for us?  These reports will be provided to the customer via SFTP.  Sample Report  Thanks and Regards,  Vinita SinghTechnical RecruiterTEK Inspirations LLC | 13573 Tabasco Cat Trail, Frisco, TX 75035E: vinita.singh@tekinspirations.com  Contact  No-+ 469-205-(6
