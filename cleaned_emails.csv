I am reaching out to you on an exciting job opportunity with one of our clients. Job Title:- IOS ENGINEERVisa :: No H1B/CPTLocation :: RemoteDuration :: 6+ months Experience :: 8+ years Client : CVSNote – Need strong candidate profile 1 - Candidates must complete the iOS Code Challenge attached. Description:Position Summary CVS Health Digital seeks to change the way individuals manage their healthcare by focusing on the features that matter to our customers, building software in a modern, lean way, and deploying continuously into the cloud. As part of an engineering team building the products supporting Aetna Digital, we help our members effectively find the care they need. What You'll Do: The engineering teams are responsible for building the best experience possible for the millions of members using our website and mobile apps. You will work alongside other engineers and with the product and design teams to consistently deliver new features. You will also work to refactor existing code in order to bring greater stability and scalability for our application as our membership continues to increase. In any given day you will: * Contribute code and tests according to criteria established by our product team * Monitor, troubleshoot, and support our application in production * Seek opportunities to enhance the stability, performance, maintainability, and extensibility of our application This job can be remotely based anywhere in the U.S. Required Qualifications * 5+ years of iOS development experience. * 5+ years of experience in Swift * 5+ years of experience with Git/GitHub * 3+ years of experience in Unit test and UI test * 2+ years of experience with SwiftUI * 1 + years of experience with accessibility/accessibility testing Preferred Qualifications * Extensive use of SwiftUI in current iOS projects * Extensive understanding of UIKit, Foundation, and other core iOS frameworks * Familiarity with Agile/SAFe software development principles * Knowledge of MVC and MVVM architectural patterns * Knowledge of iPhone accessibility features * Working with designer/design team to implement UI * Knowledge of Circle CI or other CI/CD tools Education Bachelor’s degree from accredited university or equivalent work experience (HS diploma + 4 years relevant experience) iOS Developer Candidate Code Challenge Congratulations on making it to the next phase of the interview process. We’ve developed this code challenge to help us evaluate where you are on your iOS developer journey. We’d like you to spend no more than 3 hours on this. We understand this is a serious time commitment, and we appreciate your willingness to help ensure you’ll be a great fit with our iOS development team. We’d like for you to create a simple application from scratch. At a follow-up interview, we’ll ask you to show your app to a small group of iOS developers (a code review). You’ll demonstrate the working app and then walk them through the code. They’ll ask questions about your approach to solving the coding challenges faced while developing this application. Good luck! The Rules • We expect you to write all of the code (excluding open-source libraries or auto-generated code) for this challenge. We’ll know you wrote the code if you can clearly explain it during the code review. • We’ll need you to write this app in Swift. Objective-C experience is highly valued, but Swift language experience is required. React Native and other hybrid solutions are not acceptable. • Use SwiftUI for the user interface. • Use any architectures, patterns, or techniques that you feel are appropriate for this task. Play to your skillset. • You may use the internet for help just as you normally would to find answers and code examples. • You can use any open-source libraries in your project. • You can ask for help or clarification at any time. Contact the person who sent you this code challenge and we’ll do our best to respond quickly. But if you don’t hear from us, keep coding so we have an example of your work to discuss during the review. • There is a 3-hour time limit. The Task Create an iPhone application that allows a user to search Flickr for images. Create the UI with a search bar at the top and a grid below it to display thumbnail images. The user should be able to enter text into the search bar and see a grid of images whose tags match the search string. The search string can be a single word (such as “porcupine”) or comma-separated words (such as “forest, bird”). Fetch the list of images using this API from Flickr: https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?format=json&nojsoncallback=1&tags=porcupineYou’ll replace “porcupine” in that URL with the search word(s) typed by the user. This is a free public feed. No API key is required. You can learn more about this API here: The App Garden When you’ve finished, create a public repository for your project and email the link to us. GitHub will let you create public repositories for free, but any repository we can access is fine. Acceptance Criteria • The search results should come from the API listed above (replace the word “porcupine” with the one typed by the user). • The search results should be updated after each keystroke or change to the search string. • When performing the search, show a progress indicator without blocking the UI. • Tapping on an image should display an image detail view that contains the following details: o The image o Text element that displays the title o Text element that displays the description o Text element that displays the author o Text element that displays a formatted version of the published date • Add at least one unit test that covers some portion of your code. Extra Credit Once again, there’s little value in spending more than three hours on this project. It’s more important that you demonstrate the basics well. If you complete the initial acceptance criteria with time left over, consider some of these optional tasks: • Accessibility support such as o VoiceOver support o Dynamic text support • Additional unit tests • UI tests • Support landscape orientation • Add a button in the detail view to share the image and metadata • Animate the image transition from the grid view to the detail view • Add a text element that displays the width and height of the image to the detail page o Note: This can be parsed from the description field What We’re Looking For During the code review, we’ll be looking for certain things that might indicate you have the skills we’re looking for. These things include: • Excellent communication skills. • Safe Swift code: Safety In Swift • Good coding practices. Industry-standard patterns and techniques. • Well-formatted source code, a clean and consistent style, and proper naming. • API calls and other routines that never block the main thread. • Code without retain cycles or other memory leaks. • Proper error handling. • An understanding of Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines. We expect you to fully understand every line of code in the app and be able to explain exactly how it works and why it’s the best choice if asked.

Tech jobs are gone — maybe for good Tech jobs are disappearing — and they won't be coming back anytime soon, The Wall Street Journal reports. After years of frenzied competition for talent, the industry is ""fundamentally readjusting its labor needs,"" focusing on products and services that generate revenue over ""growth at all costs."" Entry-level and recruiting roles have been hit especially hard, per The Journal, and companies are looking for engineers with larger skill sets who can do more with less. Tech editor Tanya Dua writes, “As tech has lost some of its luster, workers have been forced to consider a variety of alternatives. And an MBA seems to be increasingly top-of-mind.” ✏️ Emma W. Thorne Read more here and chime in using #AI: How has AI played a role in changing the future of the tech industry? Does competition stifle innovation? It's long been a corporate truism that stoking internal competition between employees and teams encourages harder work. But does it hold back innovation? That’s exactly what a study reported by The Wall Street Journal suggests. While the 73 teams the study looked at may have worked longer hours to compete with their rival divisions, they were less likely to share information, and less likely to receive diverse ideas. ✏️ Andrew Barker Read more here and share your POV using #Innovation: Do your experiences with internal competition at work match the findings of the study?

Our new “Content Corner” section will include tips, tricks and advice to help you along the way. 3 tips to creating an engaging LinkedIn post Looking to boost engagement on your content? Here are a few best practices to keep in mind as you craft your next post, article or newsletter: ☑️ Create a goal for your post: Think of how your content can offer something of value to the reader; generic or superficial posts are less likely to resonate. ☑️ Share a story, not a sales pitch: While you can use your content as a vehicle to share more about your business or your personal story, frame it in ways that others can relate to or ask questions about to learn more from your experience. ☑️ Keep the conversation going with a CTA (call to action): Share a CTA towards the end of your post to prompt responses for your community. We’re all experts in something and we all have knowledge and experiences to share. Lean into exchanging information with like minds on the platform around a different topic each week. This week’s topic: Amazon’s RTO What happens when the nation's second-largest private employer orders its workers back to the office full-time? Amazon — and companies across the U.S. — are about to find out. While Big Tech firms have seen flexible work as a key recruitment tool, some say they'll rethink it in light of Amazon's decision. Other industries, particularly banking, are already pushing for a full-time return to office. ✏️ Emma W.
