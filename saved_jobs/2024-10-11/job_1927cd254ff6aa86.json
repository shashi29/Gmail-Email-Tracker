Currently, all bus depots/locations rely on manual and cumbersome Excel-based processes. The expected benefits of this project are to elevate First Student to a best-in-class level. As the proof of concept wraps up, there will be a large effort to roll out the new process across all existing locations (500+). Each location operates independently \u2013 much like a franchise model, which will require significant process analysis and deep dives to understand current state. This understanding will need to rapidly be translated to the future state process while not disrupting business operations. The Financial Systems/Business analyst will be responsible for:Learning setup and processing steps for all systems involved in customer invoicing (current state and future state)Evaluating contracts and interpreting the future state system setup requirements across these systemsAnticipating scenarios/gaps that have not been documented/identified through working with locations and project teamDocumenting requirements of system gaps, reviewing with broader project team, prioritizing backlogs and assisting with testingExtensive change management, planning and relationship-building with location team members based on aggressive project scheduleHands-on training (virtual) and production support with non-technical end users Required Skills:Experience with financial systems/ERP and associated billing/invoicing business processes and approvals; JDE experience is beneficialAcute listening skills coupled with an inquisitive nature and strong yet empathetic communication \u2013 both with external locations and core project teamAbility to flex and improvise while adhering strictly to the plan and expected outcomesExtremely detail-focused and experienced in contract review and financial reconciliation from current state to future state",
