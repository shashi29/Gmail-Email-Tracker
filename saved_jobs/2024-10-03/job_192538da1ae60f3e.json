The ideal candidate will have prior business analyst experience and have a full understanding of manufacturing business processes and how SAP supports them. So, we are looking for someone that has PP, MM, IM, WM, and QM experience. This is not necessarily configuration experience, but someone from the business side who has worked as an SAP business analyst in the past. Agile experience is a huge plus. The location is the Nikola manufacturing plant in Coolidge, AZ. This is a small town between Phoenix and Tucson. It is possible that you may find someone in Phoenix or Tucson that is willing to commute but otherwise you\u2019ll have to find someone really to relocate as this is on-site job.
