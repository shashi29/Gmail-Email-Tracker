They are used to initialize the object\u2019s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.",
