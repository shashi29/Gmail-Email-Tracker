I am reaching out to you on an exciting job opportunity with one of our clients. If you are looking for a new job opportunity, please share your updated resume with your rate expectations. Position: JDE Business Analyst- Mid LevelClient: VacoCompany: FirstStudent Background: Order-to-Cash (O2C) kicked off early in 2024 as a proof of concept for a modernized billing process to bring accuracy, consistency and efficiency to customer invoicing. Currently, all bus depots/locations rely on manual and cumbersome Excel-based processes. The expected benefits of this project are to elevate First Student to a best-in-class level. As the proof of concept wraps up, there will be a large effort to roll out the new process across all existing locations (500+). Each location operates independently \u2013 much like a franchise model, which will require significant process analysis and deep dives to understand current state. This understanding will need to rapidly be translated to the future state process while not disrupting business operations. The Financial Systems/Business analyst will be responsible for:\u00b7 Learning setup and processing steps for all systems involved in customer invoicing (current state and future state)\u00b7 Evaluating contracts and interpreting the future state system setup requirements across these systems\u00b7 Anticipating scenarios/gaps that have not been documented/identified through working with locations and project team\u00b7 Documenting requirements of system gaps, reviewing with the broader project team, prioritizing backlogs and assisting with testing\u00b7 Extensive change management, planning and relationship-building with location team members based on aggressive project schedule\u00b7 Hands-on training (virtual) and production support with non-technical end users Required Skills:\u00b7 Experience with financial systems/ERP and associated billing/invoicing business processes and approvals; JDE experience is beneficial\u00b7 Acute listening skills coupled with an inquisitive nature and strong yet empathetic communication \u2013 both with external locations and core project team\u00b7 Ability to flex and improvise while adhering strictly to the plan and expected outcomes\u00b7 Extremely detail-focused and experienced in contract review and financial reconciliation from current state to future state",
