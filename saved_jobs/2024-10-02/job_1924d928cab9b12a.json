Eligibility and enrollment processes for MAGI members, currently serviced through the Health Insurance Exchange (HIX), and non-MAGI members, currently serviced through the legacy MA21 mainframe system. The system will be modernized on a modular basis to provide a single point of access for individuals and/or families applying for public health insurance benefits. The modernization will provide common data storage and eligibility determination processes and rules for all Medicaid programs. To develop a plan for implementing a single point of access for benefits, EOHHS is undertaking an intensive effort to map the current state of Medicaid and MA21 operations and the systems that support those operations, then will port those operations and systems to a new infrastructure. The MA21 system is the MassHealth legacy, mainframe-based eligibility determination system that manages seniors and those in need of long-term care services populations. These populations are also described as non-MAGI. MA21 seeks a highly motivated Sr. Business Analyst (SBA) to liaison between the business community, the technical development team, and Cloud Rehosting Vendors. The business analyst will be mainly responsible for determining operational objectives by studying existing mainframe-based business functions, gathering information, and evaluating output requirements and formats for the AWS cloud transition. The SBA for MA21 will analyze requirements, construct workflow charts and diagrams, study system capabilities, and write specifications. The SBA will analyze business and user needs and document Use Cases that conclude with approved Functional Requirements. The SBA is an active member in all phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including postproduction verification. The SBA will ensure that the implemented cloud rehosting project, maintenance enhancements that may be implemented on the cloud platform, or defect fixes that need to be remediated on the cloud platform meet the requirements of the business community. The first step in porting operations and systems to a new infrastructure will be to rehost the legacy MA21 mainframe system in the AWS cloud. The successful candidate will support the MA21 AWS Cloud rehosting effort in support of the One Health Initiative.\nResponsibilities: Act as liaison between business users, the MA21 development group, and Cloud Vendors to gather and document Scope, Use Cases, and Functional Requirements.

Serve as Project Manager, as required, for simple projects and report projects and task status to senior management. Diagnose and resolve system performance problems identified by Production Control, users, or management. Communicate effectively with business users and managers. Ensure project documentation, plans, and scheduling comply with agency initiatives and priorities.

Identify risks, potential scope creeps and escalating issues to the client and management. Create Unit test results in accordance with process Scope and Business requirements.
