It a consultant has both Data Engineer and ML certification than he /she will get interviewed immediately. Here are some of the take aways. If they are both currently certified on GCP and ML, they will move through the process quicker. This is a heavy machine learning project. They need to be able to clearly explain how they build data pipelines in BigQuery. They need to have solid experience with Code Integration Tools. Strong airflow experience. Must have trained the data models using ML. Specifically using Vertex and vertex workbench. Explain how they use Vertex to train feedback loops and work with the data scientists. This project is all about automation through ML. This does not mean that they will not be considered if they do not have the ML certification, but they will need to get it.
