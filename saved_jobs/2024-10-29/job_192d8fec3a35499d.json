I have an exciting opportunity with one of our client. If interested send me your updated resume with contact details, expected pay rate. Job Description -Client: TruistPosition: Cyber Security Program ManagerLocation: Charlotte or Atlanta(Hybrid) (Local only) Duration: 6+ MonthsVisa: No H1B, No OPTMOI: Video \"The client is going through a significant cyber security transformation. As part of this they have divided the efforts into 7 workstreams. They have good Program Managers/Project Managers for 3 of the workstreams and are having difficulties finding good fits for: Identity and Access Management, Client Identify and Access Management, Wires Systems Security and Board and Management Reporting. The PMs don\u2019t need to be cybersecurity experts, but some knowledge is helpful. At a minimum, they will need to have worked on tech projects. The core responsibilities will be maintaining project plans (they use Clarity as their PM tool), partnering with (and in some cases driving) leadership in the workstream to align scope and budget (and adjust as needed), provide monthly reporting, and complete governance processes for plan hygiene, change requests and risks/issues. \"The client is going through a significant cyber security transformation.
