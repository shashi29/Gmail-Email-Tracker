								Hi, Greetings from SourceMantra, Please have a look at the below opportunity and reply to me if you are interested. Job: QA Automation EngineerLocation :  Jacksonville Florida (Onsite) – Need localsDuration: Long Term Contract  10+ Years and passport Number is must for Submission. Job Description:Key areas they are looking for skill wise. *C# required C# (sharp) is object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft mainly for web and desktop applications.* must know how to write custom xPaths -they are not interested in someone who only uses tools for this. *Knowledge around Constructors – what they do what are they used for, etc.. *Solid Knowledge of POM Constructors: In programming, constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an instance of the class is created. They are used to initialize the object’s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.    Thanks & RegardsSharath Reesu | Source Mantra, Inc.Senior Talent Acquisition 295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Phone : +1 908 373 8651 Ext: 243 | 732 377 8653 (Fax)Sharath@sourcemantra.com |   www.sourcemantra.com

Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.  Thanks & RegardsSrujan BurraEmail: srujan@sourcemantra.comSource Mantra Inc | www.sourcemantra.com295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)

								Greetings, We have the below requirement with our Client. Kindly go through the JD below and let me know your interest. Position: Software Automation EngineerLocation: Jacksonville Florida – 100% OnsiteDuration: 12+ Months Need USC, H1B & H4 EAD candidates only. LinkedIn & Passport Number Must for Submission. Need 10+ years’ experience  Rate: $60/hr on c2c Max. Key areas they are looking for skill wiseC# required - C# (sharp) is object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft mainly for web and desktop applications.must know how to write custom xPaths -they are not interested in someone who only uses tools for this.Knowledge around Constructors – what they do what are they used for, etc.Solid Knowledge of POM Constructors: In programming, constructors are special methods in a class that are automatically called when an instance of the class is created. They are used to initialize the object’s state and set up any necessary resources or initial values. Here's a deeper look into constructors:Key Characteristics of ConstructorsInitialization: Constructors allow you to set up initial values for an object's properties or perform any setup tasks required when an object is created.Naming: In many languages, constructors share the same name as the class. For example, in C#, the constructor's name is the same as the class name.No Return Type: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. Their sole purpose is to initialize the object's state.Automatic Invocation: Constructors are automatically invoked when an object is instantiated using the new keyword (in languages like C# and Java).Overloading: Many languages support constructor overloading, which means you can have multiple constructors in a class with different parameters.  Thanks & RegardsSrujan BurraEmail: srujan@sourcemantra.comSource Mantra Inc | www.sourcemantra.com295 Durham Ave, Suite # 201, South Plainfield, NJ 07080Certified Minority Business Enterprise (MBE)
